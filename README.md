# bank-loan-prediction-using-decision-tree-random-and-boosting-algorithms

in these project we have more than 11,000 datas. which is contain customer loan prediction using multiple classification featues . many columns values are in categorical values using string so i did label encoder for categorical values after label encoder i did correlational coefficient for feature selection in these process we select our features for our model accuracy after correlational coefficient, i feel i have less number of datas in loan approval so our model can have to predict wrong rejection for approving loan so i did oversampling on low number of loan approval datas after implement decison tree classifier, random forest algorithm,Ada boosting algorithm,xg boost and Gradient boosting algorithm, i have good accuracy in random forest also other algorithms did weel in evaluation metrics i had good values in confusion matrix classification.
